//theme of game TBD. Use base for now, change styling later. styling does not matter until script is completed.

//player is shown a random goal number to work to. 19-120. 
//Math.floor((Math.random() * 102) + 19);
//math.floor with a range needs the range between the two numbers(+1) + the lower number. -TESTED ON W3SCHOOLS

//4 total buttons, bottom of page. 
//each button (crystal) needs to have a random number. (math.floor(math.random)) range of 1-12
//Math.floor((Math.random() * 12) + 1);
//math.floor with a range needs the range between the two numbers(+1) + the lower number.

//number needs to be hidden besides from watching it add to player total. Display player total.

//add random button number to total score

//player wins if total score matches the random goal number. wins ++

//player busts if it goes over. losses ++

//game restarts regardless of outcome

//reset() for all numbers, no page refresh.

//display wins+losses directly on page with $("#id").text("string"). 

//Probably use <P> <spans> </P>. If not spans, use $("#id").html(wins)
